# Data Structure and Algorithm In Python  

This repo is to help beginner understand data structure and algorithms by providing  
number of code examples designed in such a way to make the topic seemingly logical  
and easy to follow. The code examples are in python but the explanations will be   
sufficient to adapt in any language.

## Data Structures  

*List Implementations  
    * Arrays  
    * LinkedList  
    * Stacks  
    * Queue
